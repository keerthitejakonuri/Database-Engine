Note:
As index files & data.db files are already present in the folder there is no need
to parse input file.

In case it is necessary to parse input file, please delete data.tb and other 11 index files,
and then parse input file. For that make sure that PHARMA_TRIALS_1000B.csv is there in the folder.
