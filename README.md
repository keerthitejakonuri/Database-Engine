# Files-and-Indexing
Project under the course "Database Management System"


Developed a Java program that parses an ASCII text-based CSV data file, 
then transforms the same information to a memory efficient format 
and writes it to a binary data file. 

Created index files for each field of the record for efficient record retrieval 
of values from fields other than primary key. 

As a result program was able to successfully reduce the data file size by around 40% 
and still able to access records efficiently.
